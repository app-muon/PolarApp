# Minimize keep rules; add only if reflection/runtime issues occur
# Start with no keeps for RxJava/Polar SDK; both should work without keeps.
# If you hit runtime issues, uncomment only the specific lines needed.

# Example (uncomment if needed):
# -keep class io.reactivex.rxjava3.** { *; }
# -keep class com.polar.sdk.** { *; }
